# Pose Detection and Repetition Counter

## Overview

Welcome to the Pose Detection and Repetition Counter project! This application leverages the power of computer vision to detect body poses in real-time through a webcam feed. Not only does it provide accurate pose estimation using the Mediapipe library, but it also includes a smart repetition counter that analyzes the angles of key body joints to track and count repetitions during a specific exercise.

# Pose Detection and Repetition Counter

This project uses Mediapipe and OpenCV to detect body poses in real-time through a webcam feed. Additionally, it counts the number of repetitions performed during a specific exercise based on the detected angles.
```
## Key Features

- **Real-time Pose Detection:** Utilizing the capabilities of the Mediapipe library and OpenCV, the application provides a live, accurate, and robust body pose detection experience.

- **Repetition Counting:** The integrated repetition counter intelligently analyzes the angles between key joints, allowing users to effortlessly track and count repetitions during their exercise routines.

- **User-friendly Interface:** The project includes a Jupyter notebook that offers a user-friendly interface for users to easily run the application, visualize the detected poses, and monitor their workout progress.
